#welcome screen
welcome = Welcome in JCAppStore
tips = There are two things that will help you:<br> \
  1. This tool won't allow you to <b>use</b> the card application, always read the <b>use section</b> in store! <br /> \
  2. If the store cannot load your card and you don't know the reason, re-plug it. Try to restart the store. If nothing helps, \
  the card is probably broken (or cannot be modified anymore - known as SECURED state). <br><br> \

# hint applet usage
au_title = How to use applets
au_introduction = Once you install the applet, you need to use it somehow. The way the applet communicates with the computer \
  is through APDU messages (for more info check our documentation). It basically sends array of numbers with defined \
  meaning. To communicate with installed applet, you need to have either host-side application written for the applet \
  or general software that allows you to sent the APDU messages yourself.
au_host_title = Host application
au_host = If you are lucky, the host application is already written and all you have to do is visit the developer's \
  webpage and install it. The application may be with GUI like this store, then it will be intuitive. Or, the host app \
  may be for command line only. Then, you need to run the application from the command line. For command line usage, \
  see Command Line section of our help. The cmd version may be a bit harder to use, especialy for non-developers. \
  However, you don't need to send the APDU messages manually and that is the main advantage.
au_no_host_title = General APDU software
au_no_host = If the host application doesn't exist, you need to download either GPShell or GlobalPlatformPro tools and \
  install them. You need to learn how to use them so that you can send the APDU messages to specific applet on card. \
  Also, you need to learn the APDU structure and the way the developer uses it so you are able to actually communicate \
  with the card. If you are unable to install the applet using GPShell or GPPro (e.g. without this store), and not \
  willing to lear a lot of things, do not install such applets.

# hint default selected
def_title = Main applet
def_h = Also called default selected,\nan applet that is always ready to\nreceive commands.
def_introduction = Main applet (or default selected, as it is called in the Global Platform specification) is an applet \
  that are all incoming APDU commands sent to by default. The card usually hosts multiple applets and when communicating \
  with an applet, the card host has to first decide on which is the applet to talk to. This can be done usually by sending \
  SELECT command before actual communication - the card is told the applet AID we want to talk to. There is also another way: \
  creating the desired applet as a main applet. In such case, all commands (except some reserved ones) are sent to the main applet \
  by default, though other applets can be selected (SELECT command is one of the reserved ones, it is sent always to the Security \
  Domain).
def_why_title = Why making any applet MAIN?
def_why = There are two options. The first is that the host app developer was too lazy to make sure every time is the SELECT command \
  issued when talking to the card. In this case, the card will not work with such host because the host presumes the applet is \
  already selected (e.g. main). The other option is efficiency. Payment cards (credit/debit) are meant to run only one applet. \
  The card will never run other applets (except security domain), because it is already in SECURED state (e.g. management is limited). \
  Sometimes you may notice people use 'card' and 'applet' as equal terms - in this case, the applet literally equals card as the only \
  purpose of that card is to run the applet. There is no need for SELECT command - it will only slow down transactions.
def_why_main_title = Why the term 'Main applet'?
def_why_main = Because if you know the GP specification, calling it default selected makes sense. But for the majority, 'default selected' \
  is not self-explanatory. Main applet makes you think about an applet that is somehow exceptional among other applets, its existence \
  significant on the card - as a default selected applet should be.

# hint installation failures
ifaq_title = Installation failures FAQ
ifaq_h = FAQ on why your installation fails
ifaq_cardstate_title = Invalid card lifecycle state
ifaq_cardstate = If your card lifecycle state is not OP_READY (e.g. initial), the store does not support this card. There \
  other card life cycle states, the state change is usually irreversible. OP_READY state is for any initial card management \
  - installation and deletion of applets. Other states are meant for issued cards, terminated, locked etc. But if your card is \
  not in the OP_READY state, the store will refuse to recognize the card - the installation will be never allowed in the first place.
ifaq_low_memory_title = Low memory
ifaq_low_memory = Cards have limited amount of memory. Before each installation, the store installs JCMemory onto your card \
  to measure free space and to estimate the probability of low memory failure. You are always notified by the store when such \
  event occurs, simply uninstall other applets to free some memory.
ifaq_wrong_sdk_title = Wrong SDK version
ifaq_wrong_sdk = Applets are developed using libraries - SDK. Different applets support different SDK versions. The backward \
  compatibility is guaranteed. If your installation fails with unsupported SDK version, simply choose lesser SDK version \
  at the bottom of the applet store info page.
ifaq_ip_title = Invalid installation parameters
ifaq_ip = Some applets require installation parameters (advanced section of the install dialog window). More info can be found \
  in the 'Use' section of the applet store info page.
ifaq_tech_title = Unsupported technology
ifaq_tech = Various applets require various technology in order to run. EAC (extended access control) for biometric data, \
  NFC (near field communication) for wireless use, Extended Length for longer APDU commands support, various cryptographics \
  functions implementations (elliptic curves..) and many other. This info can be usually found in the official applet repository \
  - website link section of the applet store info page. About your card support, ask your vendor or see JCAlgTest database \
  (https://www.fi.muni.cz/~xsvenda/jcalgtest/).
ifaq_general_title = General failure
ifaq_general = The installation can fail with other error codes. The usual reasons are: 1) there is running app on the background \
  that keeps talking to the card. In such case, either kill this app to let the store use your card exclusively during the installation, \
  or enable 'Card exclusive mode' in the 'App' store menu; or 2) the new applet/package id collides with already installed ones - \
  you can have only unique applet/package IDs on your card simultaneously; or 3) problems with establishing channel and/or card communication \
  - there is wide variety of reasons why this can happen, simply re-plug the card and/or reader. If the problem persists, there is high \
  chance of your card being somehow broken (hw/sw issues).

# hint cmd usage
cmd_title = Command Line swift guide
cmd_introduction = Command line is the native way how to control any digital device. Graphical interface is only an \
  feature to ease the application usage, though today very common. Some applications do not have GUI, and therefore \
  you need to know how to use command line. Once running an application through command line (for example you've used \
  java -jar myapp.jar), you can typically use generaly supported command <b>--help</b> or <b>-h</b> or even <b>help</b> \
  to display help.
cmd_browse_title = Browsing the device
cmd_browse = First thing you need to do is to learn how to navigate. Next to the cursor is usually displayed your \
  current position in the directory tree structure.<br>Use command <b>cd</b> to change directory. To go into hello \
  directory, use <b>cd hello</b>. But, the hello folder has to exist inside your current folder. To go up, use <b>cd ..</b>, \
  where two dots mean parent folder. To ease the file and firectory name typing, use TAB key to fill the rest of the folder \
  name. For example, instead of typing 'hello' type 'he' only and press TAB. The computer will fill in 'hello' if such folder \
  exists or 'hella' for example, because 'hella' folder also exists and 'a' is before 'o' in alphabet. In such case, press TAB again. \
  <br>To show content of your current directory use <b>ls</b> command on linux or <b>dir</b> command on windows.\
  <br><br> IMPORTANT: as you may have noticed the commands are separated by spaces. Thus, space in any name is a problem.\
  To avoid it, enclose such filenames or folders in " or ' characters ("/my awesome folder").
cmd_launch_linux_title = Start an application - Linux
cmd_launch_linux = To start a host app, easiest way for beginners it to navigate to the directory the app is in. \
  Use <b>ls -l</b> to display the file properties. \
  If desired file contains 'x' in the permissions, then it should be ok and all you need to do is to type the filename \
  along with its extension as any other command. In case the application doesn't run, type './[appname].[extension]' instead.
cmd_launch_win_title = Start an application - Windows
cmd_launch_win = To start a host app, easiest way for beginners it to navigate to the directory the app is in. \
  Then see the file extension using dir command. If it's an 'exe' file, then it should be ok and all \
  you need to do is to type the filename along with its extension as any other command, for example myapp.exe.
cmd_lanuch_Java_title = Start Java application (.jar)
cmd_lanuch_Java = The host applications are mostly written in Java, because the card runs Java. So writing the host application \
  in Java too makes sense. To launch Java application, you need to download JRE if you don't have it already. JRE stands for \
  Java Runtime Environment and it's a software that can run the Java application. Once you have this installed, and you \
  are in a folder the .jar file is, run following command: <b> java -jar TheAppFileName.jar </b> where you need to fill in \
  the correct app file name. In case the 'java' command is not found, make sure that the JRE install folder location is \
  in your Path environment variable. This should be done automatically during install though.

#hint master key
mk_title = Card master authentication
mk_intro = The card is protected by master key. This value is set to the card by vendor, usually 4041...4E4F. However, \
  some vendors may use unique test keys or you've changed the master key; and thus we can't load the card contents. \
  The key consists of 3 parts (called mac, enc, dec) that can be converted to one single long key (password). We support only one-valued \
  master key. To derive the one key from its three parts, either ask your card vendor or search on the Internet for 'smart \
  card key diversification' or 'how to derive single key using mac enc dec'. There are several methods for the derivation; \
  you need to know which one has to be used (also ask your vendor or find this information on their website).
mk_title_ini = Providing the correct key
mk_ini = To load such card, provide the application with correct key value. You have to modify cards.ini file inside \
  JCAppStore folder located in your user folder (Documents in windows for example). Once here, modify two values under correct \
  card identifier header. This may be problem if you plugged in more than once card, because there is metadata of every card \
  that was plugged in while running store. If you don't know the id of card, try to re-plug the card onto application to display it. Find the \
  correct block with the data of the card you cannot connect to, and set key to the correct value. Set auth = true so that \
  the store will try to authenticate.

E_no_aid_on_card = Deletion failed: no such AID on card. Try to re-insert the card to get actual information about the \
  content.
E_delete_not_allowed = Deletion failed: not allowed. The applet is still possibly active. If you are uninstalling a package without \
  simple mode, uninstall its applet first. Otherwise, there is a collision in applet/package ids. Enable package listing in 'My Card' \
  section and search for any instance with similar ID that might prevent you from uninstalling the desired applet. The uninstall will \
  be possible after removing such instance. When deleting this instance, disable 'simple mode' that would uninstall any dependencies, \
  so that you will not lose any data. Package deletion without simple mode is safe.
E_connect_fail = Failed to connect to selected reader. Re-plug the reader and re-insert the card. Try this with and without 'Card exclusive mode'. If it doesn't help, \
  feel free to raise an issue on GitHub.

# SW translations ! THESE ARE USED BUT PASSED AS ARGS SO THE BUNDLE DOESN'T SEE USAGE-->
E_invalid_INS = Invalid instruction for execution. This means that command for the card sent is not supported. \
  For more info, search 'APDU invalid INStruction' or 'SW 0x6D00'.
E_invalid_CLA = Invalid instruction class for execution. This means that command for the card sent is not supported. \
  For more info, search 'APDU invalid CLA' or 'SW 0x6E00'.
E_invalid_P1P2 = Invalid instruction parameters P1 or P2 for execution. This means that the requested action requires \
  different parameters to be sent. Fusor more info, search 'APDU invalid P1P2' or 'SW 0x6A86'.
E_invalid_LC = Invalid Lc byte for outcoming data length. The applet was expected to return different data length.
E_invalid_memory = Fatal error: memory management failed during process. For more info, search 'SW 0x6581'.
E_full_memory = Memory is full. Uninstall some applets to free space. For more info, search 'SW 0x6A84'.
E_invalid_data = Incorrect installation data. Check the format, length, typos, of your input from advanced install section. \
  Check whether the applet requires installation data (use section). Check whether the card supports sdk version. Also, the software may be invalid. \
  For more info, search 'SW 0x6A80'.
E_security_failure = Security status not satisfied. The action was not considered secure and thus aborted. \
  For more info, search 'SW 0x6982'.
E_use_failure = Incorrect applet use. When installing: missing or wrong install params / applet uses algorithms or requires technology (such as NFC) \
  not supported by your card. The install parameters should be described in the 'Use' section if required. \
  Also, make sure there are no similar applets present on the card. The store should automatically remove collisions; \
  yet some applets might use custom AIDs. <br><br>Please note: in case of a big application, try to uninstall some applets first. \
  The free memory detection feature cannot detect insufficient memory with sizes around 30kB.
E_pkg_not_found = Applet or package not found. For more info, search 'SW 0x6A82'.
E_data_not_found = Referenced data not found. For more info, search 'SW 0x6982'.
E_action_denied = Unable to process requested action. The card is LOCKED. This store does not work with LOCKED cards. \
  For more info, search 'Smart Card in locked state' or 'SW 0x6283'.
E_action_not_supported = Requested action not supported (this card life-cycle state is probably LOCKED). \
  For more info, search 'SW 0x6A81'.
E_init_failed = Initialization failed. Card is maybe locked. If so, the store won't support this card.
E_eof = Unexpected end of uploaded file. Check the file correctness.
E_not_enough_data = The amount of provided in response is not enough. Please check the requirements for the command.
E_command_not_allowed = The command is not allowed. Check your rights for this command. Maybe you have to authenticate \
  first.
E_generic_invalid_command = The command parameters or data is incorrect.
E_key_usage_error = Key usage error. Check the key types and format.
E_record_not_found = Requested data not found.
E_referenced_not_found = Missing data to perform requested operation. If this error occurs on install and you have \
  correct install parameters, check for your card algorithm support: for technology used ask vendor, for the technology \
  supported by your card see JCAlgTest website. If this error occurs on uninstall, try to delete the package instead. \
  There might be problem with AID mismatch and/or collision.
E_length_00 = Correct length for 256 bytes data in array (maximum transfer size) should equal in LE to 0x00.
E_load_failed = Failed to load the applet onto card. Make sure the sdk of applet is compatible with your card.
ES_eof = The installation file is corrupted. Re-download the store.
ES_generic = Action failed. Try again. In case this error persists, check whether the card is not broken.
ES_probably_locked = The card is probably locked. The store does not support such cards.
E_card_default = Could not perform the operation. Try to re-plug the card reader. Also try it with both "Card Exclusive mode" \
  enabled and disabled. If this does not help, the card is probably broken.
E_default = Something went wrong. Try to re-start the application. If the problem persists, notify us.
E_default_try_again = Oops, something went wrong. Please, try again after re-plugging the reader/card.

# hints formatted in html-->
E_initialized = Card is in initialized state.
H_initialized = This card has been initialized. This is not an initial state: the store works with cards in OP_READY state \
  only (operation ready means that the card is ready for management).
E_secure_state = Card is in secured state.
H_secure_state = <p>This card has been secured. This means that the card has been marked as ready to work in hostile \
  environment. We cannot work with such a card and the transformation process is irreversible.</p>
E_locked = Card is in locked state.
H_locked = <p>Card is in locked state. It means that no management alternations can be performed and no other applet or \
  security domain can be selected - the card can run only one selected applet. We cannot work with such a card and the \
  transformation process is irreversible.</p>
E_terminated = Card is in terminated state.
H_terminated = <p>Card has been terminated. It means that this card will not respond to almost any command and thus the \
  card is useless. Nor we, nor anyone else can work with such a card and the transformation process is irreversible.</p>
E_no_life_state = Card life cycle state not detected.
H_no_life_state = <p>Card life cycle state can tell us whether the card is ready for installing, deleteing and other \
  management, or whether the card is no longer manageable. We were unable to determine this information and therefore \
  we will not support this card to avoid any possible damage. Re-plugging the card could help, as fetching card info \
  might (rarely) fail.</p>
E_unknown_key = Master key unknown.
E_authentication = Card authentication failed.
E_master_key_not_found = <p>Master key is unknown. We didn't try to authenticate to this card. \
  Modify <b>cards.ini</b> file inside your documents folder: JCAppStore/data/cards.ini. \
  Set <b>key = </b>[correct value here]. Also, some cards need a diversifier specified (EMV, VISA2), \
  ask your vendor if unsure. Even with correct key value and missing diversifier if required, the authentication will fail.</p>
H_authentication = <p>We were unable to guess the correct master key (password) for this card. \
  Modify <b>cards.ini</b> file inside your documents folder: JCAppStore/data/cards.ini. \
  Set <b>auth = true</b> and <b>key = </b>[correct value here]. Also, some cards need a diversifier specified (EMV, VISA2), \
  ask your vendor if unsure. \
  <br /> <b>WARNING:</b> make sure you know the correct key. After several (around 10) incorrect tries, the card \
  will get bricked.</p> 
H_not_authenticated = <p>We didn't try to authenticate to this card (auth = false is set). \
  Modify <b>cards.ini</b> file inside your documents folder: JCAppStore/data/cards.ini. \
  Set <b>auth = true</b> and <b>key = </b>[correct value here]. Also, some cards need a diversifier specified (EMV, VISA2), \
  ask your vendor if unsure. Even with correct key value and missing diversifier if required, the authentication will fail.\
  <br /> <b>WARNING:</b> make sure you know the correct key when setting auth = true. \
  After several (around 10) incorrect tries, the card will get bricked.</p>
E_communication = Card detection failed.
H_communication = Re plug the reader or card and try again.
E_generic = The following error has occurred: 
W_internet = <p>Internet connection failed. The store displayed is the last saved store version. The store data might not be up to date.</p>
E_install_not_found = <p>Unable to find requested file for install. Try to re-download the store or choose different version or sdk.</p>
E_pkg_present = Package already present on this card. It can be re-installed using advanced 'force install' option.
E_invalid_custom_install = Invalid app version or sdk selected for install.
has_keys = Keys 
H_has_keys = If this applet stores private keys\nor other sensitive data.\nIf you keep this checked, the store will\ndisplay \
  warning on attempt to uninstall.
E_timeout = The action was taking too long to finish and the process was killed. Please, create and issue with providing your log file \
  to help us solve the problem.
E_load_failed_io = Could not load the applet onto card. This can be caused by colliding package ID (make sure no same package ID is \
  present on the card). Another cause may be that the applet cannot be run on the card - incompatible SDK version or missing technology \
  features (such as NFC).
E_no_java_executable = Invalid file. Either add java executable folder to your PATH environment variable, or select the java executable. \
  Otherwise, we are unable to run the tests.
